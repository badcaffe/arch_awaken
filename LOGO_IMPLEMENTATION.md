# Logo Implementation Guide for Arch Awaken

## Summary

I've designed a cute footprint logo for your "Arch Awaken" flat foot training app and set up the infrastructure for all platforms. Here's what's been completed:

### âœ… Completed Tasks

1. **Logo Design**: Created two SVG logo files:
   - `assets/logo/arch_awaken_logo.svg` - Detailed version with animations
   - `assets/logo/arch_awaken_icon.svg` - Simplified version for small icons

2. **Design Features**:
   - Stylized footprint with emphasized arch curve
   - Cute rounded toes and soft gradients
   - Awakening sparkle effect around the arch
   - Uses the app's Peacock theme colors (#00695C primary, #4DB6AC secondary)

3. **Configuration Setup**:
   - Added `flutter_launcher_icons` package to pubspec.yaml
   - Configured icon generation for all platforms
   - Updated web manifest with app-specific colors and description
   - Added SVG assets to pubspec.yaml

### ðŸš§ Next Steps Required

## Step 1: Generate PNG Icon Files

You need to convert the SVG files to PNG format for the icon generator:

1. **Export High-Resolution PNG**:
   - Open `assets/logo/arch_awaken_icon.svg` in any vector editor
   - Export as PNG at 1024x1024 pixels
   - Save as `assets/logo/arch_awaken_icon.png`

2. **Alternative Online Method**:
   - Use https://svgtopng.com/
   - Upload `arch_awaken_icon.svg`
   - Download as PNG and save to `assets/logo/arch_awaken_icon.png`

## Step 2: Run Icon Generation

Once you have the PNG file, run these commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Generate icons for all platforms
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```

This will automatically generate all required icon sizes for:
- Android (5 density buckets)
- iOS (10+ sizes)
- Web (4 sizes)
- macOS (7 sizes)

## Step 3: Verify Installation

After icon generation:

1. **Test on Devices**:
   - Run `flutter run` on Android/iOS devices
   - Check the app icon appears correctly

2. **Check Web**:
   - Run `flutter run -d chrome`
   - Verify the PWA icon in browser tabs

## Step 4: Optional - Update Android App Label

The Android app label is currently "arch_awaken" (lowercase). To update it to "Arch Awaken":

1. Edit `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
2. Change `android:label="arch_awaken"` to `android:label="Arch Awaken"`

## Design Details

### Logo Concept: "Awakening Arch Footprint"
- **Footprint Shape**: Represents the app's focus on foot health
- **Emphasized Arch**: Highlights the arch strengthening exercises
- **Cute Aesthetic**: Soft curves, rounded toes, friendly appearance
- **Awakening Theme**: Sparkle effect symbolizes arch "awakening"

### Color Scheme
- **Primary**: #00695C (Deep teal from Peacock theme)
- **Secondary**: #4DB6AC (Light teal accent)
- **Background**: White/transparent for versatility

### Platform Support
- **Android**: Adaptive icons with teal background
- **iOS**: All required sizes from 20x20 to 1024x1024
- **Web**: PWA icons with maskable variants
- **macOS**: Full icon set for desktop

## Troubleshooting

If icon generation fails:
1. Ensure the PNG file exists at `assets/logo/arch_awaken_icon.png`
2. Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`
3. Try `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main -f` (force regeneration)

## Customization

To create color variants for different themes:
1. Edit the SVG files to use different color codes
2. Export new PNG files
3. Update the `image_path` in pubspec.yaml
4. Regenerate icons

Theme color codes:
- **Sunset**: #E65100 primary, #FF9800 secondary
- **Forest**: #2E7D32 primary, #66BB6A secondary
- **Ocean**: #1565C0 primary, #42A5F5 secondary
- **Lavender**: #7B1FA2 primary, #BA68C8 secondary
